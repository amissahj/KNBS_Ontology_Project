# Road Traffic Injury Ontology (RTIO)

An epidemiological framework ontology for analyzing road traffic injuries in Ghana with focus on Person-Place-Time relationships.

## Overview

The Road Traffic Injury Ontology (RTIO) is a semantic model designed to capture and analyze road traffic accidents and injuries within Ghana's context. The ontology follows an epidemiological framework based on **Person**, **Place**, and **Time** dimensions to provide structured representation of traffic incidents, their causes, consequences, and emergency response patterns.

### Key Features

- **Ghana-specific context**: Includes local healthcare facilities (KATH, 37 Hospital, Nyaho) and emergency services
- **Person-centered analysis**: Traffic participants, demographics, and injury outcomes
- **Geographic modeling**: Specific Ghana locations (Circle, TechJunction, TemaMotorway, Ejisu, Nkawkaw)
- **Temporal analysis**: Accident timing patterns and emergency response coordination
- **Injury classification**: Severity-based categorization with treatment requirements
- **Emergency response**: Ghana Ambulance Services, MTTD, Fire Department integration
- **Seasonal factors**: Dry season dust haze and rainy season pothole contexts

## Ontology Structure

### Core Classes

#### Person
- `TrafficParticipant`: Driver, Passenger, Pedestrian (disjoint classes)
- `PersonDemographics`: Age, gender demographics
- `InjuryType`: Fracture, HeadInjury, InternalInjury, Laceration (with severity levels)
- `VulnerableRoadUser`: Pedestrians and motorcycle/bicycle operators

#### Place   
- `IncidentLocation`: Highway, Junction, Roundabout, UrbanArea, RuralArea
- `HealthFacility`: Government (KATH, 37Hospital), Private (Nyaho), Faith-based (HolyFamily, StDominic)
- `EnvironmentalCondition`: Seasonal factors, visibility conditions
- `HighRiskLocation`: Highways, Roundabouts, Urban Junctions

#### Time
- `AccidentTiming`: MorningRush, Midday, NightDriving (disjoint classes)
- `EmergencyResponseTiming`: Response coordination timing
- `CausalTiming`: Human factors vs mechanical causes

### Sample Data Included

**Accidents**: 5 real accident instances with specific times and locations
- Accident_at_Circle_0815
- Accident_at_TechJunction_2115  
- Accident_at_TemaMotorway_1420

**People**: Kwame, Yaw, AkuffoAddo (drivers), Akosua, Ama (passengers), Kojo (pedestrian)

**Vehicles**: CarA, Bus1, Truck1, Bike1 (motorcycle), Bicycle1

**Healthcare**: Government hospitals (KATH accepts NHIS), private facilities, faith-based hospitals
