**Project Details:**: Road Traffic Injury Ontology Development

## üìã Overview

The Road Traffic Injury Ontology (RTIO) is a semantic model designed to capture and analyze road traffic accidents and injuries within Ghana's context. The ontology follows an epidemiological framework based on **Person**, **Place**, and **Time** dimensions to provide a structured representation of traffic incidents, their causes, consequences, and emergency response patterns.

### Key Features

- **Ghana-specific context**: Includes local healthcare facilities (KATH, 37 Hospital, Nyaho) and emergency services
- **Person-centered analysis**: Traffic participants, demographics, and injury outcomes
- **Geographic modeling**: Specific Ghana locations (Circle, TechJunction, TemaMotorway, Ejisu, Nkawkaw)
- **Temporal analysis**: Accident timing patterns and emergency response coordination
- **Injury classification**: Severity-based categorization with treatment requirements
- **Emergency response**: Ghana Ambulance Services, MTTD, Fire Department integration
- **Seasonal factors**: Dry season dust haze and rainy season pothole contexts

## üèóÔ∏è Ontology Structure

### Core Classes

#### Person Dimension
- `TrafficParticipant`: Driver, Passenger, Pedestrian (disjoint classes)
- `PersonDemographics`: Age, gender demographics
- `InjuryType`: Fracture, HeadInjury, InternalInjury, Laceration (with severity levels)
- `VulnerableRoadUser`: Pedestrians and motorcycle/bicycle operators

#### Place Dimension  
- `IncidentLocation`: Highway, Junction, Roundabout, UrbanArea, RuralArea
- `HealthFacility`: Government (KATH, 37Hospital), Private (Nyaho), Faith-based (HolyFamily, StDominic)
- `EnvironmentalCondition`: Seasonal factors, visibility conditions
- `HighRiskLocation`: Highways, Roundabouts, Urban Junctions

#### Time Dimension
- `AccidentTiming`: MorningRush, Midday, NightDriving (disjoint classes)
- `EmergencyResponseTiming`: Response coordination timing
- `CausalTiming`: Human factors vs mechanical causes

### Sample Data Included

**Accidents**: 5 real accident instances with specific times and locations
- Accident_at_Circle_0815
- Accident_at_TechJunction_2115  
- Accident_at_TemaMotorway_1420
- Accident_at_Ejisu_0730

**People**: Kwame, Yaw, AkuffoAddo (drivers), Akosua, Ama (passengers), Kojo (pedestrian)

**Vehicles**: CarA, Bus1, Truck1, Bike1 (motorcycle), Bicycle1

**Healthcare**: Government hospitals (KATH accepts NHIS), private facilities, faith-based hospitals

### Loading the Ontology

1. Download `RTI_exam_updated10.owl`
2. Open in Prot√©g√© or your preferred ontology editor
3. Explore the class hierarchy and sample individuals
4. Run the provided SPARQL queries for analysis

## üìä SPARQL Query Examples

This ontology includes **5 comprehensive SPARQL queries** for analytical purposes:

1. **Complete Accident Analysis** - Comprehensive accident details with participants and responses
2. **High-Risk Location Analysis** - Geographic patterns and timing correlations  
3. **Emergency Response Analysis** - Healthcare facility utilization and service coordination
4. **Injury Severity Analysis** - Treatment priorities and vehicle type correlations
5. **Seasonal/Environmental Analysis** - Ghana-specific contextual factors

**üìÇ Full Query Details**: See [`queries/sample-sparql-queries.md`](queries/sample-sparql-queries.md) for complete query syntax, expected results, and usage instructions.

### Quick Start Example
```sparql
# Find all traffic accidents with their basic details
PREFIX rtio: <http://www.example.org/rtio#>
SELECT ?accident ?location ?timing ?participant WHERE {
    ?accident rdf:type rtio:TrafficAccident .
    ?accident rtio:occurredAt ?location .
    ?accident rtio:happenedOn ?timing .
    ?accident rtio:involvesPerson ?participant .
}
```
